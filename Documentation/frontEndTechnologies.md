# Soundzone Front-End Technologies
1. React
    - React allows Soundzone to behave like a single-page application for a snappy user experience
    - Reacts built-in hooks are used throughout the app, especially useState, which is used by the 'App' component to control all of the 'Sound' components throughout the site
2. Redux
    - Redux is used extensively on Soundzone to store data recieved from the backend, and takes advantage of changes in this data to avoid unnessecary page rerenders
3. react-hook-form
    - allows for simple and powerful form validations and error handling, the built-in functions eliminated the need for a series of functions and hooks that would provide the same functionality
4. react-dropdown-select
    - allowed for easy creation of search dropdown, avoiding the need for making difficult styling of 'select' and 'option' elements
